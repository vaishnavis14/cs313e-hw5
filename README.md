The project is designed to simulate and evaluate poker hands from a standard deck of cards. It incorporates various poker hand rankings, including royal flush, straight flush, and pairs, to determine the winner among players based on their dealt hands. This project serves as a practical exercise in object-oriented programming and algorithm design, enhancing understanding of card games and probability in computer science.
